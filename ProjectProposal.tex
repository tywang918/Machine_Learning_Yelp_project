\title{Stat 561: Project Proposal}

\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	
	Our intention is to classify gentrifying hipsters, gentrifying neighborhoods, and make predictions on what area will be gentrified next. 
	\section{Data}
	Although proprietary and technically illegal\footnote{Yelp's employees were condescending and noncooperative in our attempt to purchase the data so that's Gene's justification}, we have scraped data on all businesses in San Diego, CA, as well as, data on almost all of the users who have reviewed restaurants found among the business data. For businesses we have: price category, coordinates, number of reviews, average rating, who reviewed, the text of reviews, the date of the reviews, category, and other miscellaneous information such as phone number or open hours. For users, we have the businesses that they have reviewed (including non-San Diego ones), the number of friends users have, their elite number, and who the users' friends are. Additionally, we intend to overlay/merge Yelp data with either house prices from Zillow or the Census Community Survey (the average rental/housing prices, community ethnic composition, etc) to cross-check our inferences and aid in our learning procedures.
